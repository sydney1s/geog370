    <h3>The map shows states in the US and the different languages that their populations speak.
    </h3>
    <p> The pie charts of each state show the ratio of languages spoken in each state.
        The pink slice represents total population, the green slice represents those that only speak English, the yellow slice represents those that speak a language other than English, and the blue slice represents those that speak Spanish.
        I chose this topic as language diversity is an interesting topic to me especially since I feel that the US isn't as diverse when it comes to known languages.</p>
