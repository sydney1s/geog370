    <h2>Question: Which public k-12 schools in north Mecklenburg county have a public bus stop within walking distance?</h2>
    <h3>*Walking distance defined as 1/2 mile*</h3>
    <p>For my analysis, I imported vectors of points of CMS schools and points of CATS bus stops. I first started by adding
        a 1/2 mile buffer around each bus stop, operationalizing this buffer as walking distance. Then, I used the intersection tool
        to find which CMS school points intersect with the 1/2 mile buffer around each bus stop. I defined these intersected points
        as the schools that are within walking distance of a bus stop. Then, I used the difference tool to find the difference of school points and 
        the 1/2 mile buffer. I then defined those points as schools that don't have a bus stop within walking distance. Finally, I changed the 
        colors of the intersected points to green and the colors of difference points to red, making the example more visual. As seen in the map,
        the green points are schools that have a bus stop in a 1/2 mile walking distance and the points in red represent schools without 
        a bus stop in walking distance.
